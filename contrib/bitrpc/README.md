### BiDMOC
Allows for sending of all standard Bitcoin commands via RPC rather than as command line args.

BiDMOC.py is able to do the exact same thing as `walletchangepass.py` and `walletunlock.py`. Their respective commands in BiDMOC.py are:

	biDMOc.py walletpassphrasechange
	biDMOc.py walletpassphrase
